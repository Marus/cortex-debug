There are many `User/Workspace Settings` to control things globally. You can find these in the VSCode Settings UI. `launch.json` can override some of those settings. There is a lot of functionality that is available via `Settings` and some may be useful in a team environment and/or can be used across all cortex-debug sessions

![](./images/cortex-debug-settings.png)

The following attributes (properties) can be used in your `launch.json` to control various aspects of debugging. Also `IntelliSense` is an invaluable aid while editing `launch.json`. With `IntelliSense`, you can hover over an attribute to get more information and/or help you find attributes (just start typing a double-quote, use Tab key) and provide defaults/options.

If the type is marked as `{...}` it means that it is a complex item can have multiple types. Possibly consult our Wiki
