Low, medium, high are importance/usefulness. But they sometimes represent *bang-for-the-buck* as well where the effort could be high vs. relative usefulness. Some of there are here because there is new functionality in VSCode APIs

* Low: `Set Value` in `Watch` Window

# Other

* Medium: Sooner or later we need to migrate our code base to eslint. This is very deinquent and a huge number of changes are required. I don't have all the expertise to do this smoothly
* Low: WSL: First class support. This includes Docker, WSL and perhaps 'ssh'. VSCode and WSL seem to be maturing. Still not there but...there may be enough.
  * This may not be needed anymore since there is an effort to support a USB proxy mechanism in WSL. If that works out, then there is no need for us to do anything. As of Jun 2022, this is look more promising
